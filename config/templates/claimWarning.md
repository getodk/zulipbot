Hello @{commenter}!

You have attempted to claim an issue {state} the {labelGrammar} {list}. It seems like you are new to Open Data Kit, so we suggest working on a [good first issue](https://github.com/{repoOwner}/{repoName}/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) issue first. After doing one quick win, then try a [help wanted](https://github.com/{repoOwner}/{repoName}/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) issue. We also recommend reading [README.md](https://github.com/{repoOwner}/{repoName}/README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/{repoOwner}/{repoName}/CONTRIBUTING.md) before getting started.

To claim this issue anyway, comment on this issue again with the command `@{username} claim --force`.
